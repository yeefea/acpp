# 继承、动态绑定

```c++
class Core{
public:
// ...
protected:
// ...
private:
// ...
};

class Grad : public Core{
public:
// ...
protected:
// ...
private:
// ...
}

```
## 访问权限控制

- public
- protected
- private

## scope运算符`::`

```c++
::grade(...);
// ::前没有任何class，是为了区分类外部的非成员函数
```

## 子类初始化过程

- Allocating space for the entire object (base-class members as well as derived  members)
- Calling the base-class constructor to initialize the base-class part(s) of the object
- Initializing the members of the derived class as directed by the constructor initializer
- Executing the body of the derived-class constructor, if any


## 虚函数

用来实现动态绑定。

无论是否调用虚函数，虚函数一定要定义，否则会保奇怪的错。
One final note about virtual functions: These functions must be defined, regardless of whether the program calls them. Nonvirtual functions may be declared but not defined, as long as the program does not call them. Many compilers generate mysterious error messages for classes that fail to define one or more virtual functions. If your program evokes a message from the compiler that you do not understand, and that message says that something is undefined, you should verify that you have defined all of your virtual functions. You are likely to find that the error goes away when you do so.

## virtual destructor



## handle class

本章用两种方法实现多态
- 引用、指针
- handle class

## 构造函数和虚函数

在构造函数中调用虚函数是静态绑定的，绑定到正在构建的类型。

## 类函数

`static`关键字，类函数中无法访问`this`指针，类函数智能访问其他的    `static`成员。

## 子类初始化过程

- Allocating space for the entire object (base-class members as well as derived  members)
- Calling the base-class constructor to initialize the base-class part(s) of the object
- Initializing the members of the derived class as directed by the constructor initializer
- Executing the body of the derived-class constructor, if any


## 虚函数

无论是否调用虚函数，虚函数一定要定义，否则会保奇怪的错。
One final note about virtual functions: These functions must be defined, regardless of whether the program calls them. Nonvirtual functions may be declared but not defined, as long as the program does not call them. Many compilers generate mysterious error messages for classes that fail to define one or more virtual functions. If your program evokes a message from the compiler that you do not understand, and that message says that something is undefined, you should verify that you have defined all of your virtual functions. You are likely to find that the error goes away when you do so.
